ambiguous_custom_block_signature=Names for custom blocks are non-unique. Two custom blocks with the same name can only be distinguished if they have a different number or order of parameters. Try to always make the names for custom blocks unique.
ambiguous_parameter_name_unused=Scratch allows multiple parameter with the same name in one custom block. However, it cannot distinguish between these parameters afterwards, causing problems in your program. Always use parameters with unique names.
ambiguous_parameter_name_used=Scratch allows multiple parameter with the same name in one custom block. However, it cannot distinguish between these parameters afterwards, causing problems in your program. Always use parameters with unique names.
blocking_if_else=You are using [sbi]stop [all v][/sbi] or [sbi]stop [this script v][/sbi] blocks in both the [IF] and [ELSE] branch of this block. So the script terminates anyway and the blocks after the [sbi]if < > then[/sbi] are never executed. Try using the stop command only in one branch or remove the blocks after the [sbi]if < > then[/sbi].
blocking_if_else_inside_loop=You are using [sbi]stop [all v][/sbi] or [sbi]stop [this script v][/sbi] blocks in both the [IF] and [ELSE] branch of this block. So the script terminates anyway and the loop outside the [sbi]if < > then[/sbi] is never correctly executed. Try using the stop command only in one branch or remove the loop.
boolean_expression=Good! You use boolean expressions in your program.
busy_waiting_script=In your script you are constantly checking a condition, just to stop the script once the condition is met. Use the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] block instead of the forever and if combination to end your script when the condition is met.
busy_waiting_all=In your script you are constantly checking a condition, just to stop everything once the condition is met. Use the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] block instead of the forever and if combination to end your script when the condition is met.
busy_waiting_clone=In your script you are constantly checking a condition, just to delete the clone once the condition is met. Use the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] block instead of the forever and if combination to end your script when the condition is met.
call_without_definition=If you used a custom block in your program and deleted it, there may still be pieces of code referring to this custom block. Make sure to delete all instances, where the deleted custom block was used.
event_check_in_loop=Very good! To ensure that you don´t miss on an event you continuously check for it in a forever loop.
clone_type_1=There are identical statements in multiple scripts. A custom block could simplify your code.
clone_type_2=There are similar statements in multiple scripts, differing only in parameters. A custom block could simplify your code.
clone_type_3=There is similar code in multiple scripts. A custom block could simplify your code.
collision=Well done! Your sprite shows a certain behavior (e.g. looks or motions) when it collides with or touches something.
comparing_literals_default_true=You compared two texts. You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return [TRUE]. Consequently, your code inside the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] slot is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Therefore the block is obsolete.
comparing_literals_default_false=You compared two texts. You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return [FALSE]. Consequently, your code inside the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] slot is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Change the comparison to something meaningful or replace the structure.
comparing_literals_default_without_information=You compared two texts. You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Change the comparison to something meaningful or replace the structure.
comparing_literals_default_variable=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, your code inside the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] slot is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var]? If so, you should go to the variables toolbox and make a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var] first. Then try to use the new [var]%VARIABLE[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_default_variable_exists=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, your code in side the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] slot is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you rather intend to use a block for your defined variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var]?
comparing_literals_default_variable_two=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, your code inside the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] slot is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both? If so, you have to go to the variables toolbox and make a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both first. Then try to use the new [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] and/or [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_default_variable_exists_two=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, your code inside the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] slot is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both? If so, you have to go to the variables toolbox and use the [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] and/or [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_default_variable_two_without_information=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both? If so, you have to go to the variables toolbox and make a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both first. Then try to use the new [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] and/or [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_default_variable_exists_two_without_information=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both? If so, you have to go to the variables toolbox and use the [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] and/or [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_default_variable_without_information=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var]? If so, you should go to the variables toolbox and make a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var] first. Then try to use the new [var]%VARIABLE[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_default_variable_exists_without_information=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Did you rather intend to use a block for your defined variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var]?
comparing_literals_wait_true=You compared two texts. You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return [TRUE]. The blocks after the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] will be executed %ALWAYSNEVER. Therefore the block is obsolete.
comparing_literals_wait_false=You compared two texts. You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return [FALSE]. The blocks after the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] will be executed %ALWAYSNEVER. Change the comparison to something meaningful or replace the structure.
comparing_literals_wait_variable=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, the blocks after the Wait will be executed %ALWAYSNEVER. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var]? If so, you should go to the variables toolbox and make a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var] first. Then try to use the new [var]%VARIABLE[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_wait_variable_exists=You used [var]%VARIABLE[/var] just as a text. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, the code following the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you mean to use the block for your own variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var] in the comparison? You can find this block in the section variables.
comparing_literals_wait_variable_two=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, your code after the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both? If so, you have to go to the variables toolbox and make a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both first. Then try to use the new [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] and/or [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] block in your comparison.
comparing_literals_wait_variable_exists_two=You are comparing two values that don't change at all while your program runs. Your pointed block will always return %TRUEFALSE%ADDINFODICT. Consequently, your code after the [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] block is %ALWAYSNEVER executed. Did you rather intend to use a variable [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] or a variable [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] or both? If so, you have to go to the variables toolbox and use the [var]%VARIABLE1[/var] and/or [var]%VARIABLE2[/var] block in your comparison.
coordination=Super! You can coordinate your scripts within the program very well! That is essential for larger programs.
correct_broadcast=Super! You correctly implemented a broadcast, now you can easily coordinate all your scripts.
custom_block_usage=Very good! You know how to create your own block and also how to use it in you program.
custom_block_with_forever=If a custom block contains a forever loop and the custom block is used in the middle of another script, the script will never be able to finish. The forever loop in the custom block cannot be left, resulting in the calling script never being able to proceed.
custom_block_with_termination=The custom block [sbi]%METHOD[/sbi] contains a [sbi]stop [all v][/sbi] or [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] and the custom block is called in the middle of another script, the script will never reach the blocks following the call of [sbi]%METHOD[/sbi]. Delete the [sbi]stop [all v][/sbi] or [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] in the custom block [sbi]%METHOD[/sbi] or use an [sbi]if < > then[/sbi] block to not stop in every execution.
counter=Very good! You use a variable as a sort of counter in your loop. You have a good understanding for loops and the utilization of them.
dead_code=Your project contains blocks lying around. That means, there are blocks which will never be executed. This makes the project cluttered. You can delete these blocks.
directed_motion=Super! Triggered by a keystroke your sprite can move directed. That is an important concept for most computer games.
duplicate_sprite=Your project contains multiple exact copies of the same sprite. This makes the project cluttered. Consider using cloning instead.
double_if=Your project contains a duplicated if-condition. This makes the project cluttered. Consider shortening the program by merging the two if-statements in a single conditional statement.
duplicated_script=Your project contains the identical script twice. You probably only need one of them, and could delete all copies.
empty_control_body=There is no code inside your [sbi]%BLOCKNAME[/sbi]. Consequently, nothing happens when it is invoked. This makes your code harder to understand. Consider deleting the block if you don't need it.
empty_custom_block=You created a custom block which contains no statements. When the custom block is invoked, nothing happens. Consider deleting the custom block if you don't need it.
empty_project=Your project is completely empty. Let's begin by adding the first sprite.
empty_script=You use an empty event block. When the event occurs, nothing will happen. Delete this block if nothing should happen. If not add blocks after this one.
empty_sprite=The sprite %SPRITE contains no blocks. It can not react to any user input or sprite interaction. If this is intended leave it as is. Otherwise you have to think what the sprite should do and introduce scripts to this sprite.
endless_recursion_broadcast=If a custom block calls itself inside its body and has no condition to stop the recursion, it will run for an indefinite amount of time.
endless_recursion_procedure=If a message is sent in the same script it was received and the script has no condition to stop the recursion, it will run for an indefinite amount of time.
expression_as_touching_or_color=This block expects a colour or a sprite as parameter and does not work correctly with a string or a number. You probably should remove the reporter block.
forever_inside_loop=The inner loop [sbi]forever[/sbi] is never left. All blocks inside this script but outside of the forever loop are never executed again. Try omitting the inner loop.
gliding_motion=Super! Triggered by a keystroke your sprite can make a gliding motion. That is an important concept for most computer games.
illegal_parameter_refactor=The parameter has the wrong type. By editing the custom block the boolean parameter was made into a number or text parameter. To fix this undo the editing.
immediate_delete_clone_after_broadcast=The script deletes the clone immediately after the [sbi]broadcast (%MESSAGE v)[/sbi] block. The script that starts with [sbi]when I receive [%MESSAGE v][/sbi] for this message in this clone of the Sprite %SPRITE won't be executed right. It is better to use a [sbi]broadcast (%MESSAGE v) and wait[/sbi] block instead.
immediate_stop_after_say_think=The script stops everything immediately after the [bc]%SAYTHINK[/bc] block. The text is never shown. Replace the [bc]%SAYTHINK[/bc] block with a [sbi]%SAYTHINK ( ) for ( ) seconds[/sbi] block.
inappropriate_handler_delete_clone=The script contains a [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] block. It can't be executed, because in the event handler it isn't clear which clone should be affected. The script has to start with a [sbi]when I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]when this sprite clicked[/sbi] block. Another possibility would be moving the [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] block to a script starting with one of these blocks.
initialized_parameter=You know that a parameter should to be initialized before used.
initialize_location=Super! You initialize the location of your sprite with every new program start.
initialize_looks=Super! You initialize the looks of your sprite and other program features with every new program start.
interrupted_loop_sensing=The [bc]%BLOCKNAME[/bc] block interrupts the checking of the condition in the [bc]%THENELSE[/bc] block while being executed. It can happen that the condition occurs but your script doesn't react accordingly because it is busy doing the [bc]%BLOCKNAME[/bc] block. Consider doing the condition checking in a separate (parallel) script.
list_usage=Well done! You can use a list and therefore handle important concepts of collections in programming.
long_script=The script you created is very long. Please divide it into two or more smaller scripts: each smaller script should be responsible for one subtask to keep track of it.
loop_one=If you set the number of repetitions in a loop to 1 it is executed once. You could just as well just remove the loop block, and simply connect the blocks inside the loop directly into your script.
loop_zero=If you set the number of repetitions in a loop to 0 it is never executed. You could just as well just remove the loop block and the blocks inside it.
message_naming=The message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc] doesn't have a meaningful name. You are using the default name or one that is already used followed by a number. This makes your program hard to understand. Use a meaningful, unique message.
message_never_received=The message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc] that is being sent by this broadcast is never received by a [sbi]when I receive [message v] [/sbi] block. Therefore nothing will happen as a reaction to this message. When you send a message make sure that another script receives it.
message_never_sent=message_never_sent= The message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc], that is supposed to be received is never sent. Therefore the script will never be triggered. If you want to receive a message, you have to select a message that is being sent in a different script, or create a new message to send in a different script.
message_never_sent_say_think=The message %MESSAGE this block should receive is never sent. This script will never be triggered. You are using the message as text in a [sbi]%SAYTHINK ( )[/sbi] or [sbi]%SAYTHINK ( ) for ( ) seconds[/sbi] block in the sprite(s): %SPRITE. When a script waits for a message to receive, you have to take care, that you send it with a [sbi]broadcast (%MESSAGE v)[/sbi] block.
message_never_sent_touching=The message %MESSAGE this block should receive is never sent. This script will never be triggered. You are using a [sbi]touching (%SPRITE v)?[/sbi]' block in: %SPRITE. When a message about a touching event should be sent to all sprites you have to use an additional [sbi]broadcast (%MESSAGE v)[/sbi] block.
middle_man_broadcast=Using a broadcast receiver only to send a broadcast again is considered a code smell, as the script is a middle man between the original sender and the final receiver. Consider to change the message of the final receiver to the message sent of the first broadcast and then delete the middle man to save redundant code.
middle_man_procedure=Using a custom block only to call another custom block is considered a code smell, as the first custom block is a middle man between the original caller and the final custom block. Consider to change the call of the first custom block to a call of the final custom block and then delete the middle man to save redundant code.
missing_ask=Your project uses the [sbi](answer)[/sbi] block, but the [sbi]ask ( ) and wait[/sbi] and wait block is never used in the project. The [sbi](answer)[/sbi] block can not return a meaningful value. Use the [sbi]ask ( ) and wait[/sbi] block before the first instance of [sbi]answer[/sbi].
missing_backdrop_switch=If the [sbi]When backdrop switches to [ v][/sbi] block is used to start a script and the backdrop never switches to the selected one, the script is never executed. Make sure to change the backdrop in your project.
missing_clone_call=If the [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] block is used to start a script, but the sprite is never cloned, the event will never be triggered and the script will not be executed. Make sure to use a clone block for this sprite.
missing_clone_initialization=When a sprite is cloned but it has no scripts started by [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi] events, clones will not perform any actions. Maybe you want to use one of those event handlers in your project. Otherwise you could use the [sbi]stamp[/sbi] block in the pen extension if the clone should only be visible.
missing_clone_initialization_delete_clone=When you clone a sprite but it has no scripts started by [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi], the clone is unable to perform any actions. You are using a [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] in a script of %SPRITE. Consider starting that script with a [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or a [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi] block.
missing_clone_initialization_delete_clone_message=When a sprite is cloned but it has no scripts started by [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi] events, clones will not perform any actions. Maybe you want to use one of those event handlers in your project. You are using a [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] block in a script of %SPRITE that starts with message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc]. Search the sprite %SPRITE for the script sending the message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc]. Consider starting that script with a [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi] block instead of the [bc]%EVENTHANDLER[/bc] block.
missing_clone_initialization_delete_clone_message_multiple=When a sprite is cloned but it has no scripts started by [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi] events, clones will not perform any actions. Maybe you want to use one of those event handlers in your project. You are using a [sbi]delete this clone[/sbi] block in a script of %SPRITE that starts with message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc]. Search the sprite %SPRITE for the scripts sending the message [bc]%MESSAGE[/bc]. Consider starting that scripts with a [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] or [sbi]When this sprite clicked[/sbi] block instead of the [bc]%EVENTHANDLER[/bc] blocks.
missing_erase_all=If a sprite uses a pen down block but never an erase all block, then all drawings from a previous execution remain for the next run too. Maybe you should use an [sbi]erase all[/sbi] block after your hat block.
missing_initialization=In this sprite, [var]%VARIABLE[/var] is not initalized before it is used the first time. It will use whatever value it contained at the end of the last run. Initialize the [var]%VARIABLE[/var] by assigning the desired initial value at the beginning of a suitable script.
missing_loop_sensing=The highlighted event in the script is only checked once. The script is ending too fast. Enclose the event with the block [sbi]forever[/sbi], to continuously check for the event.
missing_loop_sensing_variable=Your script should execute actions when the variable has a specific value. You have to check for this event continuously inside a [sbi]forever[/sbi] loop for not missing the event.
missing_pen_down=You use the [sbi]pen down[/sbi] block but you never lift the pen again, so your sprite will draw forever. Make sure to use a [sbi]pen up[/sbi] block in the sprite.
missing_pen_up=You use the [sbi]pen up[/sbi] block but your sprite has never set the pen down before. Make sure to use a [sbi]pen down[/sbi] block if you want to draw something.
missing_resource=Your program is missing the sound or picture you're trying to use. Select another sound ot image or add the one you intend to use.
missing_termination=The [sbi]repeat until < >[/sbi] blocks require a stopping condition. If the condition is missing, the result is an infinite loop. This will then prevent the execution of blocks following the loop in the script.
missing_wait_condition=The [sbi]wait until < >[/sbi] blocks require a condition. If the condition is missing, the block will wait forever and the following code is never executed.
mouse_follower=Very nice! Your sprite can follow the mouse. That can be a nice concept for lots of games.
movement_in_loop=Well done! The movements of your sprites are very fluent and natural because you implemented the moves in a loop.
multiple_attribute_modifications=There are multiple changes to the same variable or attribute in sequence, which could be replaced by a single statement.
nested_conditions=Very good! You use nested conditions, such as nested [sbi]if < >, then[/sbi] blocks. That can help you solve more advanced problems.
nested_condition_in_loop=Very good! You continouosly check for conditions within a loop. You know how to combine important control blocks and that can help you solve more advanced problems.
nested_loops=If two or more loops are nested, there often occur some unpredictable problems.
nested_loops_perfume=Good! You used nested loops such as nested [sbi]forever[/sbi] and [sbi]repeat ( )[/sbi] blocks. That can help you solve more advanced problems.
no_working_scripts=Your sprite only has loose hat blocks and other blocks lying around. Make sure to connect the hat blocks to the other blocks so that the sprite can react to the events.
object_follower=Very nice! Your sprite can follow other objects. That can be a nice concept for lots of games.
orphaned_parameter=If you delete a created parameter again, be sure to remove it from all the locations, where you used it before.
parallelization=Well done! You start at least two scripts on the same event. Congratulations, you implemented the concept of parallelization.
parameter_out_of_scope=Make sure, that you use the parameters of a custom block only inside of this block.
position_equals_check=A sprite's position is usually defined by its center. It is unlikely that the %COORDINATE coordinate of an object has the exact value of the comparison. Instead try to use an approximation with [LEQ] or [GEQ].
position_equals_check_dist=A sprite's position is usually defined by its center. It is unlikely that the distance between two objects has the exact value of the comparison. Instead try to use an approximation with [LEQ] or [GEQ].
position_equals_check_zero_sprites=The distance between two sprites is usually measured from center to center. It is very unlikely that the centers of two sprites will ever be exactly on top of each other. Remove the [EQ] and instead use a suitable approximation with [LEQ] or use a touching-block [sbi]touching ( v)?[/sbi], [sbi]touching color [#11ff33]?[/sbi], [sbi]color [#11ff33] is touching [#11ff33]?[/sbi] from the sensing toolbox.
position_equals_check_zero_mouse=The distance between a sprite and the mouse-pointer is usually measured from center to center. It is unlikely that the center points of mouse-pointer and sprite will ever be exactly on top of each other. Instead remove the [EQ] block and try to use a suitable approximation with [LEQ] or use a touching-block [sbi]touching ( v)?[/sbi], [sbi]touching color [#11ff33]?[/sbi], [sbi]color [#11ff33] is touching [#11ff33]?[/sbi] from the sensing toolbox.
recursive_cloning=Scripts starting with [sbi]When I start as a clone[/sbi] should not create clones of itself. This could result in an infinite number of clones.
same_variable_different_sprite=The same variable name is used in multiple sprites. This can be confusing. Make sure, that you use unique names for your variables.
say_sound_synchronization=Super! To make your sprite talk, you play a sound at the same time a speech bubble appears. That is a great feature for games.
search=Good! To have more control over your program, you continouosly check for certain conditions before broadcasting or stopping the program/script.
sequential_actions=Your script contains a sequence of repeated similar statements, which could be shortened by using a loop.
sprite_naming=The sprite %SPRITE doesn't have a meaningful name. You are using the default name or one that is already used followed by a number. This makes your program hard to understand. Give your sprite a meaningful, unique name.
stuttering_movement=If you press a key for longer, you expect a constant event processing. Unfortunately there is a delay between the first and second round of processing, making the movement stutter. You can prevent this delay by using the block [sbi]<key %KEY pressed?>[/sbi] from the sensing category in scratch. To do that you have to put the conditional [sbi]if <key (%KEY v) pressed?>, then[/sbi] block inside of a [sbi]forever[/sbi] block and use the event handler [sbi]When green flag clicked[/sbi] instead of using the event handler [sbi]When key [v] pressed[/sbi].
terminated_loop=The loop is terminated before it actually repeats (e.g. by a stop-block).
type_error=Some of the comparisons compare attributes of different types.
type_error_weird_distance=You are using a block inside [sbi]distance to ( v)[/sbi] to which you can not measure distance. Use the mouse-pointer or sprite name options given to you by the [sbi]distance to ( v)[/sbi] block.
unnecessary_if_after_until=You are using an [sbi]if < >, then[/sbi] block after an [sbi]until < >[/sbi] block with the same condition. The blocks inside the [sbi]if < >, then[/sbi] block are always executed. you can remove the [sbi]if < >, then[/sbi] block.
unnecessary_if_after_until_else=You are using an [sbi]if < >, then else[/sbi] block after an [sbi]until < >[/sbi] block with the same condition. The blocks inside the upper part of the [sbi]if < >, then else[/sbi] block are always executed. you can remove the [sbi]if < >, then else[/sbi] block.
unnecessary_glide=You are using a [sbi]glide ( ) secs. to ( v))[/sbi] block. Since the time value is 0 this block is executed immediately. You can use a [sbi]go to ( v))[/sbi] block instead.
unnecessary_glide_xy=You are using a [sbi]glide ( ) secs. to x: ( ) y: ( ))[/sbi] block. Since the time value is 0 this block is executed immediately. You can use a [sbi]go to x: ( ) y: ( )[/sbi] block instead.
unnecessary_say=You are using a [sbi]say ( ) for ( ) seconds[/sbi] block. Since the time value is 0 this block has no effect. You can delete it.
unnecessary_think=You are using a [sbi]think ( ) for ( ) seconds[/sbi] block. Since the time value is 0 this block has no effect. You can delete it.
unnecessary_wait=You are using a [sbi]wait ( ) seconds[/sbi] block. Since the value is 0 this block has no effect. You can delete it.
unused_custom_block=You created a custom block but you never use it in your project. This makes the project cluttered. Delete the custom block.
unused_parameter=You created a parameter but you never use it in your procedure. This makes the custom block harder to understand. Delete the parameter.
unused_variables=You created a variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var] but you never use it in your project. This makes the project harder to understand. Delete the variable [var]%VARIABLE[/var] or use the blocks [sbi]set [%VARIABLE v] to ( )[/sbi], [sbi]change [%VARIABLE v] by ( )[/sbi] in your project.
unused_variables_list=You created a list [var]%VARIABLE[/var] but you never use it in your project. This makes the project harder to understand. Delete the list [var]%VARIABLE[/var] or use the blocks [sbi]add ( ) to [%VARIABLE v][/sbi], [sbi]add ( ) at ( ) of [%VARIABLE v][/sbi] in your project.
useful_position_check=Well done! In Scratch the values for x- and y- coordinates are very exact floating point values. An [EQ] check with these numbers can cause problems. To avoid that, you used [LEQ] or [GEQ] operators.
valid_termination=You implemented a valid termination condition in your loop, that prevents the loop to run forever.
variable_as_literal=You are using the name of a variable as text. Did you mean to use the variable block for [var]%VARIABLE[/var] instead?
variable_initialization_race=A variable is initialized in different scripts triggered by the same event. The result may change depending on the order in which the scripts are executed. Try assigning the values in only one of the scripts.
backdrop_switch_and_event=Very nice! You use the backdrop change event to start different scipts. That allows you to perform different actions depending on the backdrop of the game.
